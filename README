What is this program ?

DVDRip is a DVD ripper for BeOS based on libdvdcss and libdvdread. It reads data from DVDs (even encrypted ones) and copy them on the hard drive.

I wrote none of the decryption code. If you want to print some possibly-illegal source code on your T-shirt, print libdvdcss' one ;)


How do I use DVDRip ?

The FAQ file should include all the indications you'll need.
